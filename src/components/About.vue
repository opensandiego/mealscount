        <h1>About Meals Count</h1>
        <p>
Meals Count is a collaboration between <a href="https://opensandiego.org">Open San Diego</a>,
 <a href="https://www.cfpa.net">California Food Policy Advocates</a>, and the <a href="https://www.sandiegohungercoalition.org/">San Diego Hunger Coalition</a>.
        </p>

        <p>The Meals Count team believes all children should have access to the food they need to learn, 
            grow, and thrive. To that end, our team supports the expansion of the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), 
            a federally authorized option for schools to offer universal meals (aka meals that are free of charge to all students).</p>

        <p>The Meals Count website features an interactive, customizable tool to help school districts, charter schools, 
            and county offices of education maximize CEP funding in order to make universal mal programs attainable and sustainable. 
            Meals Count is driven by an <a href="https://github.com/opensandiego/mealscount-backend">open source software application</a> 
            that automatically calculates optimal school groupings for the purposes of CEP, eliminating the need for time-consuming, 
            often-overwhelming manual calculations. </p>

        <p>All software is licensed with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT License</a> and was primarily developed by volunteers
            at or associated with Open San Diego, a brigade of <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>.</p>
